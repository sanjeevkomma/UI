# Conclusion
* **Use AngularJS** if you need a **complete framework** for building SPAs and prefer a strongly opinionated structure.
* **Use ReactJS** if you need a **lightweight, flexible library** for building reusable components and modern UIs.
* **Use Node.js** if you're focused on **server-side development**, especially for real-time apps, REST APIs, or scalable applications.
