# Definition
* Component is a reusable, self-contained building block of a user interface.
* Think of components as functions or classes that return UI elements (usually written in JSX, a syntax similar to HTML)

# Key Concepts of React Components:
# 1. Types of Components
1. **Function Components :**  The modern standard. These are just functions that return JSX
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Header() {
  return <h1>Welcome!</h1>;
}

export default Header; // 🔁 Exporting the component

==================

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
2. **Class Components :** (older style)
```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```
# 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
* JSX lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript
  ```jsx
     return <div>Hello World</div>;
  ```

# 3. Props (Properties)
* Inputs to components. Passed like attributes in HTML
  ```jsx
  <Welcome name="John" />
  ```
# 4. State
* Internal data, a component can manage and change
  ```jsx
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  ```
# 5. Lifecycle (only for class components or hooks in functional components)
* How a component behaves during its creation, updates, and removal
# 6. Component Composition
* Components can contain other components, making complex UIs manageable

# Example: Functional Component with Props and State
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter({ start }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(start);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Summary
* **A React component:**
  * Can be a function (modern) or a class (older).
  * Accepts props as input.
  * Manages state (if needed).
  * Returns JSX, which React renders as HTML.

# 1. Arrow Function
* An arrow function is a concise way to write a function using the => syntax introduced in ES6. It does not have its own this binding, which makes it very useful in React and modern JavaScript
* **Syntax**
```js
const functionName = (parameters) => {
  // function body
  return result;
};
```
* **Example**
```js
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
