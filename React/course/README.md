# To Read
* The primary difference of Flux vs Redux is that Flux includes multiple Stores per app, but Redux includes a single Store per app
* React doesn’t use "plain HTML" — it uses JSX (JavaScript XML)
* JSX (HTML-like code)

# In React
1. **.js file --> contains --> HTML code**
2. **.jsx file --> contains --> HTML code**
3. **.html file --> contains --> JS code**
      
* You can not manually write JavaScript code inside HTML file
* We can not write js code in .html file because React uses JSX and a component-based architecture
* JSX is not about putting JavaScript and XML into an HTML file.
* Instead, JSX lets you write HTML-like UI directly in JavaScript code — and React handles the rest
