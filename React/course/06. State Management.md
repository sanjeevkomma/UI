# Hooks
* Hooks are functions that let you use state, lifecycle, and other React features in functional components (without needing class components)

# Why Hooks?
* Before Hooks, functional components were stateless and couldn’t manage lifecycle methods. Hooks allow you to:
  * Manage state (useState)
  * Perform side effects (useEffect)
  * Use context (useContext)

# Commonly Used React Hooks
