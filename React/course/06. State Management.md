# Hooks
* Hooks are functions that let you use state, lifecycle, and other React features in functional components (without needing class components)

# Terminology
* Hook = built-in function
# Why Hooks?
* Before Hooks, functional components were stateless and couldn’t manage lifecycle methods. Hooks allow you to:
  * Manage state (useState)
  * Perform side effects (useEffect)
  * Use context (useContext)

# Commonly Used React Hooks

# Example: useState and useEffect
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count changed:', count);
  }, [count]); // Runs every time `count` changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Rules of Hooks
1. Only call hooks at the top level of a function component (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions).
2. Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks
