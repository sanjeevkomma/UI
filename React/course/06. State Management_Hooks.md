# Hooks
* Hooks are functions that let you use(hook into) react features like state, lifecycle methods and context from function components(without needing class components)

# Terminology
* Hook = built-in function
# Why Hooks?
* Before Hooks, functional components were stateless and couldn’t manage lifecycle methods. Hooks allow you to:
  * Manage state (useState)
  * Perform side effects (useEffect)
  * Use context (useContext)

# Commonly Used React Hooks

# Example: useState and useEffect
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count changed:', count);
  }, [count]); // Runs every time `count` changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
# 1. useState syntax
```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```
  * const [city, setCity] = useState("Hyderabad");
# 2. useEffect syntax
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code here (e.g., fetching data, setting up subscriptions)
  
  return () => {
    // Cleanup function (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

# Rules of Hooks
1. Only call hooks at the top level of a function component (not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions).
2. Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks

# State Management with Conditions

# useReducer Hook
* **Purpose:** More structured state management, similar to Redux-style reducers
* To manage / update multiple states at a time
* multiple state management
