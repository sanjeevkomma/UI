* React handles events in a similar way to DOM events, but with a few key differences to make it more consistent and declarative
# Key Concepts 
* **Syntax Difference**
  * **HTML (Vanilla JS):**
    ```html
    <button onclick="doSomething()">Click me</button>
    ```
  * **React (JSX):**
    ```jsx
    <button onClick={doSomething}>Click me</button>
    ```
* ✅ Note: React uses camelCase for event names (e.g., onClick, not onclick)
* ✅ The event handler is passed as a function, not a string
